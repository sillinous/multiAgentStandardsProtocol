**Break-Even Month:** Month 4 (positive cumulative cash)

**Cash Reserve Needed:** $100,000 (to cover first 3 months + contingency)

---

## Break-Even Analysis

### Membership Break-Even

**Fixed Costs (Annual):** ~$400,000 (minimal staffing + essential operations)

**Variable Costs per Member:** Minimal (~$500 for onboarding, support)

**Break-Even Members (at full price):**
- 8 Platinum members = $400,000
- OR 16 Gold members = $400,000
- OR 40 Silver members = $400,000
- OR Mix: 3 Platinum + 10 Gold + 10 Silver = $400,000

**Conclusion:** Consortium is viable with 20-30 paying members at full price.

### Certification Break-Even

**Fixed Costs (Certification Program):** $150,000/year (staff, infrastructure, test suite maintenance)

**Variable Cost per Certification:** $500 (review time, support)

**Break-Even Certifications:**
- 60 Silver certs = $150,000 net revenue
- OR 30 Gold certs = $135,000 net revenue (plus member value)

**Conclusion:** Certification program profitable at 60+ paid certifications per year.

---

## Sensitivity Analysis

### Scenario 1: Optimistic (30% Better)

**Year 1:**
- 26 founding members (vs. 20)
- Revenue: $600K
- Expenses: $590K (slightly higher for more members)
- Net: +$10K

**Year 3:**
- 78 members (vs. 60)
- Revenue: $3.0M
- Net: $1.0M+

### Scenario 2: Base Case (As Planned)

- As modeled above
- Year 1: -$87K (covered by reserves)
- Year 3: +$795K

### Scenario 3: Conservative (30% Worse)

**Year 1:**
- 14 founding members (vs. 20)
- Revenue: $320K
- Expenses: $540K (still need core team)
- Net: -$220K (requires more seed funding)

**Year 3:**
- 42 members (vs. 60)
- Revenue: $1.6M
- Expenses: $1.4M (slight scale-back)
- Net: +$200K

**Mitigation for Conservative Scenario:**
- Delay some hires (start with 1.5 FTE instead of 2.5)
- Reduce marketing spend
- Extend founding member period
- Seek additional sponsorships
